        <h1>Citizenship</h1>
        <p>The character of an individual viewed as a member of society; behavior in terms of the duties, obligations, and functions of a citizen.Honesty is important because without it everybody would be lying and nobody would be trusted. Compassion is needed so we can feel bad for each other and understand tough circumstances people are going through in order to help them through their struggles. Respect is very important because by respecting someone, it shows that they are a valuable member of society, and everyone should be respected. Responsibility is very important because people have to own up to their actions and accept the proper consequences that comes with doing certain things. Courage is important for people to take risks and break new limit so a society can advance. One additional component of being a good citizen that is not listed above is being rational by using reason. If a good citizen weren't rational, then people would be doing irrational things leading to more problems and less solutions to those problems, because people would not be acting with reason. My most recent act of powerful citizenship was helping a freshmen when they asked me where their class was. It was an important piece of citizenship because I helped another person with their day and helping them locate their class and I helped them to not be late for their class as well.
